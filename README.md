SauceDemo_SeleniumFramework is hybrid automation framework developed for UI testing of an open source website - Sauce Demo.
This framework leverages the powerful features of Selenium, a widely-used tool for web automation, and TestNG, a testing framework for Java. 
By integrating these technologies, the framework offers a flexible and scalable solution for automating UI tests across different platforms and environments. 
The hybrid approach combines the best of data-driven and keyword-driven methodologies, allowing for efficient test script development, maintenance, and execution. 
Through this framework, we were able to achieve reliable and robust UI test automation, improving our testing efficiency and software quality.
Page Objects are created to effectively interact with Web elements and synchronization is achieved using combination of implicit and explicit waits.
A utility is created to read data from an excel sheet based on Test case name which increases usability of this framework.
The test scripts have been executed successfully in following diferent ways:
1. Using Maven commands from CLI
2. Using TestNG suite xml file 
3. Using pom.xml file
4. Using run.bat file
5. From Jenkins as a Maven project (using pom.xml file).
